# Simple Express Site

My previous simple website run using Node, now rewritten using Express.

This project is done following The Odin Project, which can
be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/nodejs/lessons/introduction-to-express).

## Usage

To run the application, use **node app.js**.

There are three possible url locations:

- localhost:8080
- localhost:8080/about
- localhost:8080/contact-me

Any other url locations will display an appropriate 404 error page.
